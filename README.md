# text-to-visual-novel
Converts text into a visual novel format (NVL style) for those who prefer to digest their information that way


# How to use
So the plan is, this just takes in a bunch of text, parses it into a renpy equivalent script, and then BAM.
Simply replace a script.rpy in an already existing renpy project and you are good to go my friend.

Thoughts on how to improve this: Ideally, if we don't require the user to compile the renpy themselves.
* Idea: Simply precompile a template, then just copy the entire damn thing and replace the script and boom
* but that's a pretty big directory, about 144M...
* look for the compile script and see how that works?
