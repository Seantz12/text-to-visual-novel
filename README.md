Converts text into a visual novel format (NVL style) for those who prefer to digest their information that way


# How to use

Currently there is no interface or anything fancy like that and even the wikipedia article I use is hard coded but:
1. Navigate to the ttvn folder
2. run python main.py -d {directory}
3. Navigate to directory and run .exe or run the .sh (must give permissions)
